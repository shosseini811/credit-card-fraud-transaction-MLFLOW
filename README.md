###  Comparing the Models
Use the MLflow UI to compare the models that you have produced. In the same current working directory as the one that contains the mlruns run:
mlflow ui

and view it at http://localhost:5000.
On this page, you can see a list of experiment runs with metrics you can use to compare the models.
